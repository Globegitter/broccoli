- symlink instead of copying in merge-tree and filter
  - probably must not symlink to other symlink, as we may exceed max level (32 on Mac, 40 on Linux)
    - benchmark says we also incur perf hit on indirection
    - so need to use lstat to check if source is symlink, and if so, readlink and resolve
      - some perf overhead here, but should be ok, is further optimizable too
- resolve all or absolute?
  - relative doesn't seem terribly important, so can resolve?
  --> resolve all - different behavior on relative vs absolute is Just Wrong
- Windows?
  - needs elevated privileges, and I'm worried about pitfalls
  - perhaps let's just not try to symlink on Windows ever
- symlinks to dirs
  - follow (so using stat, not lstat, in walk-sync)


To do for change:

add symlink resolver on build
make merge-tree and filter use symlinks
  on Windows, copy
release Broccoli
release plugins a week later
